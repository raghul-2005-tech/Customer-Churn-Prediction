# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning to predict which customers are likely to leave a telecommunications company. 

## Steps Completed
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and converted text data to numeric format.
2. **Data Splitting:** Divided data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
3. **Model Selection:** Chose the Random Forest Classifier algorithm.
4. **Training:** Trained the model on customer tenure, contract types, and charges.
5. **Evaluation:** Achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%.

## Tools Used
* Google Colab (Python)
* Pandas & Scikit-Learn
* Matplotlib (for visualization)
